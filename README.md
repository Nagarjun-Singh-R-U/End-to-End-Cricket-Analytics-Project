# End-to-End-Cricket-Analytics-Project

## Problem Statement:

In This project Created a Power BI Dashboard which helps to review and compare performances of all the players in T20 Men's Cricket World Cup 2022 tournament. This dashboard also enables us to select the best 11 of the tournament based on their performance based on defined selection criteria which is included as a part of problem statement.

## Key Steps:
###   1. Web Scraping Data from ESPN Cricinfo:

*   Utilized the third-party web scraper "Bright Data" to effectively gather information from the ESPN Cricinfo website, including match data, results, player batting data, and bowling data.
*   The scraped data was stored in the form of JSON for further processing.

###   2. Data Transformation and Conversion:

*   Leveraged Python and Pandas to transform the JSON data into CSV format.
*   Ensured the data was in a suitable format to be directly used in Power BI, simplifying the process of joining tables.

###   3. Power BI Dashboard Creation:

*   Utilized Power Query in Power BI to further transform and clean the data for analysis.
*   Created dynamic dashboards with interactive charts and visualizations, presenting measures for various aspects, such as power hitters, middle-order batsmen, and bowlers.
*   These dashboards provided valuable insights into player performance, team strengths, and areas of improvement.

###   4. Forming the Best Playing 11:

*   Applied data-driven analysis and decision-making techniques to form the best playing 11 based on the requirements and insights obtained from the dashboard.
*   The combined playing 11 was determined to optimize team performance and increase the chances of success in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2022.
